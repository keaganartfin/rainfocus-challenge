## Some features: ##

* **Mobile Responsive** ( max-width: 768px )
  * Sidebar 
    * Sidebar will hide to the left of the screen until the hamburger icon is clicked/tapped. Then the Sidebar will ease into the viewport.
    * Navigation li's have :hover styling as well as an 'active' style when clicked. They all open and collapse when clicked revealing a submenu.
  * The content section will shrink information blocks and align text to the center of divs depending on the current viewport.

* **Light & Dark Theme**
  * When the profile button (bottom left) is clicked will change the theme of the page to a Dark Theme coded from the ground up.

* **Add Registration Workflow**
  * Step 2 : Build Registration Workflows contains a *Add Registration Workflow* box that, when clicked, transforms into a form that a user can input information and create a new registration box.
